# Implementation Progression Plan for Unshallow CLI Tool

## Phase 1: Core Migration Infrastructure

**Goal**: Build the foundational migration components with a simple CLI for single-file testing

### 1.1 Configuration Management

- Build config system for UNSHALLOW.md and unshallow.env (`src/server/config/`)
- Add model tier selection per workflow node
- Implement runtime configuration validation
- Create configuration loading utilities

### 1.2 Logging Infrastructure

- Create structured logging system for migration tracking (`src/server/shared/logging/`)
- Add progress tracking and error reporting
- Implement log aggregation for debugging
- Build logging interfaces for workflow integration

### 1.3 File System Module

- Build file access layer with worktree support (`src/server/file-system/`)
- Implement dual access patterns (main repo + worktree)
- Add path resolution for transparent file operations
- Create test file discovery functionality

### 1.4 Git Management Module

- Implement git worktree operations (`src/server/git-management/`)
- Add worktree creation, branch association, and cleanup
- Build commit/push logic for successful migrations
- Handle isolation between concurrent tasks

### 1.5 Patch System

- Migrate existing patch application tool to new architecture (`src/server/patch-system/`)
- Integrate with GPT-4.1 diff generation
- Ensure single-file modification constraints
- Add diff validation and integrity checks

### 1.6 Workflow Migration

- Port existing LangGraph workflow from `obsolete/` to new `src/server/workflow/`
- Adapt workflow nodes to new modular architecture
- Maintain existing migration logic while modernizing interfaces
- Create workflow orchestrator for single-file execution

### 1.7 Simple Test CLI

- Build minimal CLI for single-file testing: `unshallow-dev test-single [file]`
- Test complete workflow end-to-end with basic console logging
- Validate git worktree isolation
- Verify patch application and rollback

**Deliverables**: Working single-file migration with git worktree isolation

## Phase 2: Task Management Layer

**Goal**: Add parallel processing and queue management without server infrastructure

### 2.1 Task Management Core

- Implement task queue with LevelDB persistence (`src/server/task-management/`)
- Create task entities with worktree associations
- Build task status tracking and progress monitoring
- Add priority and retry mechanisms

### 2.2 Worker Thread Management

- Implement worker pool for parallel processing
- Create worker thread isolation for migrations (sandboxed per file/worktree)
- Add worker -> coordinator communication for event streaming
- Handle worker lifecycle and error recovery

### 2.3 Queue Management

- Integrate better-queue with LevelDB backend
- Implement task scheduling and distribution
- Add queue persistence and recovery on restart
- Create queue monitoring and statistics

### 2.4 Enhanced Test CLI

- Build folder-scanning CLI: `unshallow-dev test-folder [directory]`
- Add concurrent processing capabilities
- Implement basic console logging for progress
- Test queue persistence and worker coordination

**Deliverables**: Parallel folder processing with persistent queue management

## Phase 3: Server + UI Integration

**Goal**: Build web-enabled server with real-time UI communication

### 3.1 Hono.js Server Foundation

- Set up Hono.js server framework (`src/server/api/`)
- Create REST API endpoints for migration control
- Add CORS enabled for all (local development)
- Implement server lifecycle management

### 3.2 WebSocket Event System

- Build real-time communication layer (`src/server/websocket-events/`)
- Create event system for progress updates
- Add client subscription and broadcasting
- Implement job control via API (pause, resume, retry)

### 3.3 Production CLI

- Build final CLI: `unshallow migrate [folder]`
- Integrate server startup and lifecycle
- Add configuration file reading
- Serve SPA UI assets

### 3.4 SPA UI Integration

- Install shadcn components
- Pull components from Vercel v0 UI project
- Create SPA that connects to WebSocket and API
- Add real-time migration monitoring interface

**Deliverables**: Complete web-enabled CLI with SPA UI for real-time monitoring

## Phase 4: Production Readiness

**Goal**: Prepare for deployment with CI/CD, testing, and distribution

### 4.1 CI/CD Pipeline

- Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Add build verification and type checking
- Implement automated formatting and linting
- Create release automation

### 4.2 Bundle and Distribution

- Configure TypeScript build for production
- Set up NPM package publishing
- Create executable binaries if needed
- Add installation and update mechanisms

### 4.3 Integration Testing

- Create example repository for testing
- Build end-to-end migration scenarios
- Add integration test suite
- Verify complete workflow functionality

### 4.4 Evaluation System

- Create migration quality metrics
- Build success rate tracking
- Add performance benchmarking
- Implement regression testing

### 4.5 Documentation and Examples

- Write comprehensive usage documentation
- Create migration examples and best practices
- Add troubleshooting guides
- Document API and configuration options

**Deliverables**: Production-ready NPM package with comprehensive testing

## Key Principles Throughout All Phases

### Development Approach

- Each phase builds incrementally on the previous
- Maintain working state at each checkpoint
- Test thoroughly before moving to next phase
- Focus on core functionality before optimization

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each module as developed
- Manual testing with example projects
- Automated regression testing

### Documentation Requirements

- Module-specific documentation with Mermaid diagrams
- API documentation for server components
- Usage examples and troubleshooting guides
- Architecture updates as system evolves

### Quality Standards

- TypeScript strict mode throughout
- Comprehensive error handling
- Structured logging and monitoring
- Performance optimization where needed
