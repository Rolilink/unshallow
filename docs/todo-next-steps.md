# Next Steps - Unshallow Refactoring

## Current Status

- âœ… High-level architecture plan completed and documented
- âœ… README updated to reflect refactoring status
- ðŸ”„ Ready to begin implementation

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Define Claude Code - Human Workflow

- Establish clear collaboration patterns between Claude Code and human developer
- Define handoff points for different types of tasks
- Clarify when to use Claude vs when human intervention is needed
- Set up development workflow and communication protocols

### 2. Define Implementation Order

Need to prioritize the implementation of modules in the correct dependency order:

- Determine which modules to build first (likely shared utilities, then core infrastructure)
- Plan incremental implementation to maintain working state at each step
- Identify critical path dependencies between modules
- Schedule when to integrate with existing LangGraph workflow

### 3. Important Reminders for Development

#### Breaking Changes Are Acceptable

- This is a **breaking migration** - complete architectural overhaul
- **No backward compatibility** concerns - this is a personal tool
- **No users to support** during transition
- Feel free to completely restructure, rename, or remove existing code
- Focus on clean architecture over migration compatibility

#### Context for AI Assistant

- This refactoring involves moving from CLI-only to web-enabled architecture
- Existing LangGraph workflow in `obsolete/` folder should be preserved and integrated
- New modular structure prioritizes maintainability over preserving old patterns
- Server-centric architecture with ephemeral state management

## Architecture Reference

See [high-level-architecture.md](./high-level-architecture.md) for complete technical specification.

## Development Approach

- Incremental implementation with working checkpoints
- Test each module as it's built
- Keep existing workflow logic intact while building new infrastructure around it
- Focus on clean separation between CLI, UI, and Server modules
