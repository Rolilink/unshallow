## Phase 1: Core Migration Infrastructure

**Goal**: Build the foundational migration components with a simple CLI for single-file testing

**Status**: ⚠️ **4/7 COMPLETED** (Configuration ✅, File System ✅, Git Management ✅, Patch System ✅)

### 1.1 Configuration Management ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **Built config system** for UNSHALLOW.md and unshallow.json (`src/core/config/`)
- ✅ **Added model tier selection** per workflow node (nano, mini, full)
- ✅ **Implemented runtime configuration validation** with comprehensive schema checks
- ✅ **Created configuration loading utilities** with environment and project config support

### 1.2 Workflow Migration ⏳ **NEXT PRIORITY**

- Port existing LangGraph workflow from `obsolete/` to new `src/core/workflow/`
- **Refactor workflow nodes to use ReAct agents**:
  - **Planning Agent**: ReAct agent for creating migration plans
  - **Migration Agent**: ReAct agent for executing migrations and fixes
  - **Lint Fix Agent**: ReAct agent for resolving linting issues
  - **TypeScript Fix Agent**: ReAct agent for resolving type errors
- Each agent will have access to tools for their specific domain
- Maintain existing migration logic while modernizing to agent-based approach
- Create workflow orchestrator for single-file execution
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Config, ✅ File System, ✅ Git Management, ✅ Patch System

### 1.3 File System Module ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **Updated file access layer** for workflow integration (`src/core/file-system/`)
- ✅ **Implemented IFileSystem abstraction** with FileSystem and RootedFileSystem
- ✅ **Added path resolution** for secure file operations
- ✅ **Created comprehensive test coverage** with unit and integration tests

### 1.4 Git Management Module ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **Updated git operations** for workflow integration (`src/core/git/`)
- ✅ **Implemented IGitRepository abstraction** with GitRepository class
- ✅ **Built foundation** for future worktree support with proper abstraction
- ✅ **Added comprehensive testing** with mock and real git operations

### 1.5 Patch System ✅ **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **Migrated existing patch application tool to new architecture** (`src/core/patch-diff/`)
- ✅ **Implemented complete V4A diff format support** with context-based patching
- ✅ **Created comprehensive testing suite** (139 unit tests + 9 integration tests)
- ✅ **Added diff validation and security checks** with path traversal protection
- ✅ **Built programmatic API** with PatchDiff class for workflow integration
- ✅ **Documented subsystem architecture** with detailed technical specification
- ✅ **Ensured single-file modification constraints** through security validation
- ✅ **Integrated fuzzy matching algorithm** for resilient context matching

### 1.6 Logging Infrastructure ⏸️ **PENDING**

- Create structured logging system for migration tracking (`src/core/shared/logging/`)
- Add progress tracking and error reporting
- Implement log aggregation for debugging
- Build logging interfaces for workflow integration
- **Dependencies**: ⏳ Workflow Migration

### 1.7 Simple Test CLI ⏸️ **PENDING**

- Build minimal CLI for single-file testing: `unshallow-dev test-single [file]`
- Test complete workflow end-to-end with basic console logging
- Validate git worktree isolation
- Verify patch application and rollback
- **Dependencies**: ⏳ Workflow Migration, ⏸️ Logging Infrastructure

**Deliverables**: Working single-file migration with git worktree isolation

### 🎯 **Current Focus: Workflow Migration (1.2)**

With the foundational infrastructure complete (Config, File System, Git Management, Patch System), the next major milestone is migrating the LangGraph workflow to the new architecture. This represents the core business logic and will enable end-to-end migration testing.

## Phase 2: Task Management Layer

**Goal**: Add parallel processing and queue management without server infrastructure

### 2.1 Task Management Core

- Implement task queue with LevelDB persistence (`src/server/task-management/`)
- Create task entities with worktree associations
- Build task status tracking and progress monitoring
- Add priority and retry mechanisms

### 2.2 Worker Thread Management

- Implement worker pool for parallel processing
- Create worker thread isolation for migrations (sandboxed per file/worktree)
- Add worker -> coordinator communication for event streaming
- Handle worker lifecycle and error recovery

### 2.3 Queue Management

- Integrate better-queue with LevelDB backend
- Implement task scheduling and distribution
- Add queue persistence and recovery on restart
- Create queue monitoring and statistics

### 2.4 Enhanced Test CLI

- Build folder-scanning CLI: `unshallow-dev test-folder [directory]`
- Add concurrent processing capabilities
- Implement basic console logging for progress
- Test queue persistence and worker coordination

**Deliverables**: Parallel folder processing with persistent queue management

## Phase 3: Server + UI Integration

**Goal**: Build web-enabled server with real-time UI communication

### 3.1 Hono.js Server Foundation

- Set up Hono.js server framework (`src/server/api/`)
- Create REST API endpoints for migration control
- Add CORS enabled for all (local development)
- Implement server lifecycle management

### 3.2 WebSocket Event System

- Build real-time communication layer (`src/server/websocket-events/`)
- Create event system for progress updates
- Add client subscription and broadcasting
- Implement job control via API (pause, resume, retry)

### 3.3 Production CLI

- Build final CLI: `unshallow migrate [folder]`
- Integrate server startup and lifecycle
- Add configuration file reading
- Serve SPA UI assets

### 3.4 SPA UI Integration

- Install shadcn components

### 4.1 CI/CD Pipeline

- Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Add build verification and type checking
- Implement automated formatting and linting
- Create release automation

### 4.2 Bundle and Distribution

- Configure TypeScript build for production
- Set up NPM package publishing
- Create executable binaries if needed
- Add installation and update mechanisms

### 4.3 Integration Testing

## Key Principles Throughout All Phases

### Development Approach

- Each phase builds incrementally on the previous
- Maintain working state at each checkpoint
- Test thoroughly before moving to next phase
- Focus on core functionality before optimization

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each module as developed
- Manual testing with example projects
- Automated regression testing

### Documentation Requirements

- Module-specific documentation with Mermaid diagrams
- API documentation for server components
- Usage examples and troubleshooting guides
- Architecture updates as system evolves

### Quality Standards

- TypeScript strict mode throughout
- Comprehensive error handling
- Structured logging and monitoring
- Performance optimization where needed
