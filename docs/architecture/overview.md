# High-Level Architecture Plan for Unshallow CLI Tool

## Primary Architecture Separation

The architecture is built around three main modules with clear separation of concerns:

### 1. CLI Module

- Single command interface: `unshallow migrate [folder]`
- Configuration file reading (`UNSHALLOW.md`, `unshallow.json`)
- Server lifecycle management (start/stop)
- Minimal, focused responsibility

### 2. UI Module

- Empty folder (handled by external Vercel v0 project)
- Will connect to server via WebSocket and API calls

### 3. Server Module

- Core business logic and infrastructure
- All workflow, task management, and file system operations
- Ephemeral in-memory state (except git worktrees/branches)
- Hono.js-based API and WebSocket endpoints for UI communication
- **Configuration Management**: Implemented core module for environment and project config

## Key Technical Stack & Features

### Hono.js Server Framework

- **Fast & Lightweight**: Modern web framework for Node.js
- **API Routes**: Clean REST endpoint definitions
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time communication with UI
- **Middleware**: Built-in support for CORS, logging, validation
- **TypeScript-First**: Excellent TypeScript integration

### Ephemeral State Management

- All workflow state stored in-memory only
- LevelDB exclusively for worker/task/queue persistence
- Server startup clears all previous tasks
- Git worktrees and branches are the only persistent artifacts

### Git Management Module

- **Worktree Creation**: Isolated workspaces per migration task
- **Branch Association**: Link worktrees to specific branches
- **UI Integration**: Support for requeueing, transforming worktrees to branches
- **Commit/Push Logic**: Handle successful and failed migration commits
- **Cleanup Operations**: Automatic worktree deletion when appropriate

### File System Module

- **Dual Access**: Main repository (read, test discovery) + worktree (read/write)
- **Worktree-Aware**: All file operations understand current working context
- **Path Resolution**: Transparent handling of main vs worktree file paths
- **Test Discovery**: Scan main repository for Enzyme test files

### Patch System

- **GPT-4.1 Integration**: Generate file diffs using advanced model capabilities
- **Patch Application**: Migrate existing patch tool for applying diffs
- **Single File Updates**: Workflow restricted to modifying only target file
- **Diff Validation**: Ensure patch integrity before application

### Model Configuration System

- **Tier Selection**: nano, mini, full (default: mini)
- **Per-Node Configuration**: Different tiers for plan, migrate, lintFix, tsFix
- **ReAct Agents**: All workflow nodes use ReAct agents with configurable model tiers
- **Environment Configuration**: Model selection via unshallow.json with type-safe validation
- **Cost Optimization**: Balance between quality and API costs

### Task Management

- **LevelDB Queue**: Persistent task storage for worker coordination
- **Worker Threads**: Parallel processing of migration tasks
- **In-Memory State**: Workflow progress and results stored temporarily
- **Clean Startup**: Fresh state on each server restart

### Workflow Integration

- **Existing LangGraph**: Reuse current workflow nodes and logic
- **Worker Isolation**: Each task runs in separate worker thread
- **Progress Events**: Real-time updates via WebSocket
- **File Constraints**: Single file modification per workflow execution

## Configuration Files

### UNSHALLOW.md

- Migration context and rules
- Project-specific patterns and conventions
- Business logic guidance for migrations

### unshallow.json

- **API Keys**: OpenAI (required), Langfuse (optional)
- **Model Tiers**: Per workflow node (plan, migrate, lintFix, tsFix) using ReAct agents
- **Commands**: Configurable commands (test, lint, lintFix, typeCheck)
- **Validation**: Type-safe configuration with comprehensive error handling
- **Defaults**: Sensible fallbacks for partial configuration
- **JSON Format**: Structured configuration with full TypeScript support

## Implemented Core Modules

### Configuration Management (âœ… COMPLETED)

The configuration management system has been fully implemented with comprehensive testing:

- **ConfigurationManager**: Central orchestrator for all configuration operations
- **Environment Config**: Loads and validates `unshallow.json` with required OpenAI API key
- **Project Config**: Loads plain text `UNSHALLOW.md` content for migration context
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with no `any` usage
- **Validation**: Comprehensive error handling and validation logic
- **Testing**: 109 test cases with 100% coverage (unit + integration tests)

#### Key Features:
- Fail-fast configuration loading with descriptive errors
- Partial configuration support with sensible defaults
- Model tier validation for ReAct agents
- Git repository root detection with CWD fallback
- Type-safe utility methods for accessing configuration

#### Documentation:
- [Configuration Management Module](./modules/configuration-management.md)
- [File System Module](./modules/file-system.md)
- [Git Repository Module](./modules/git-repository.md)

## Core Workflows

### Migration Process

1. CLI discovers test files in main repository
2. Tasks created in LevelDB queue with associated worktrees
3. Worker threads execute workflow in isolated environments
4. Real-time progress via WebSocket to UI
5. Successful migrations ready for commit/push via UI

### UI Control Flow

- Monitor migration progress in real-time
- Requeue failed tasks
- Transform worktrees to permanent branches
- Commit and push completed migrations
- Manual intervention for complex cases
