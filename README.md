# Unshallow

## ⚠️ Currently Under Major Refactoring

This project is currently being refactored to implement a new modular architecture. The current implementation is broken and non-functional.

**Status**: Breaking changes in progress - this is a personal tool and backward compatibility is not a concern during this refactor.

## What's Being Built

Unshallow is being rebuilt as a CLI tool for migrating Enzyme tests to React Testing Library with:

- Modern modular architecture (CLI, UI, Server separation)
- Real-time web UI monitoring
- Git worktree-based isolation
- Parallel processing with worker threads
- LangGraph workflow integration

See [docs/high-level-architecture.md](./docs/high-level-architecture.md) for the complete architectural plan.

## Development Status

This tool is currently non-functional during the refactoring process. Please refer to the todo list for current development priorities.
