# Todo for V0

- Implement retry logic
	- gherkin plan will be saved in the unshallow folder
  - will look for ./unshallow folders.
  - will start from the run test step and start fixing it
  - if it failed on the lint or ts step will do as well
  - requires `--retry` option
- Add separation to user context file
	- <plan> for the plan step
	- <execution> for the execution steps (both migrate and fix)
	- <error-analysis> for the error analysis step
	- <ts> for the fix ts import step.
	- <lint> for the fix lint step.
- Implement multiple files support (via directory) and parallel execution
- Implement meta report
	- last error attempt will be saved in the unshallow folder
  - after running all the files it will collect summarize each log of the migration
    - then will sumarize each summary in look for patterns and repeated errors
    - it will provide and detailed .md summary with code examples
- Fix the issue where ts files are not being imported and we need to do `/index.js` instead.
