# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Unshallow project, focusing on a dependency-first approach.

## Implementation Order

### Core Dependencies

1. **Context Enricher**
2. **LangGraph Workflow**
3. **LangGraph Observer**
4. **State Management Layer**
5. **Sequential Migration Manager**
6. **Migration Service**
7. **React UI Components**
8. **CLI Layer**

## Implementation Prompts

### 1. Context Enricher

**Prompt:**
```
Implement the Context Enricher module.

READ THESE SPEC FILES FIRST:
- context-enricher.md
- tech-stack.md (AST Analysis & File Processing section)

This is a core dependency that should be implemented as a standalone module with no integration with other components.
```

### 2. LangGraph Workflow

**Prompt:**
```
Implement the LangGraph Workflow system.

READ THESE SPEC FILES FIRST:
- langgraph-workflow.md
- workflow.md
- tech-stack.md (LLM Integration section)

This is a core dependency that should be implemented as a standalone module with no integration with other components.
```

### 3. LangGraph Observer

**Prompt:**
```
Implement the LangGraph Observer pattern.

READ THESE SPEC FILES FIRST:
- langgraph-bridge.md
- tech-stack.md (Event Handling section)

This is a core dependency that should be implemented as a standalone module with no integration with other components beyond LangGraph.
```

### 4. State Management Layer

**Prompt:**
```
Implement the State Management Layer.

READ THESE SPEC FILES FIRST:
- state-management.md
- tech-stack.md (State Management section)

This should now integrate with the LangGraph Observer to receive events.
```

### 5. Sequential Migration Manager

**Prompt:**
```
Implement the Sequential Migration Manager.

READ THESE SPEC FILES FIRST:
- sequential-migration-manager.md
- workflow.md
- tech-stack.md (Event Handling section)

This should now integrate with the LangGraph Workflow and LangGraph Observer.
```

### 6. Migration Service

**Prompt:**
```
Implement the Migration Service.

READ THESE SPEC FILES FIRST:
- migration-service.md
- high-level-architecture.md
- tech-stack.md

This should now integrate with the Context Enricher, Sequential Migration Manager, and LangGraph Observer.

Ensure the service passes through custom command options for:
- Lint checking
- Lint fixing
- TypeScript checking
```

### 7. React UI Components

**Prompt:**
```
Implement the React UI components.

READ THESE SPEC FILES FIRST:
- ui.md
- state-management.md
- tech-stack.md (UI Framework section)

This should now integrate with the State Management Layer.
```

### 8. CLI Layer

**Prompt:**
```
Implement the CLI Layer.

READ THESE SPEC FILES FIRST:
- cli-layer.md
- tech-stack.md (CLI Framework section)

This is the final integration point that should now integrate with the Migration Service.
