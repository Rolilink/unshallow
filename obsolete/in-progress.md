# EnrichedContext Refactoring - Progress Summary

## Context Summary

We've refactored the `EnrichedContext` interface to move from a component-centric approach to a file-centric approach:

1. **Initial Problem**: We had two different `EnrichedContext` interfaces:

   - One in `source/context-enricher/interfaces/index.ts`
   - Another in `source/langgraph-workflow/interfaces/index.ts`
   - Both with similar purposes but different structures

2. **Changes Made**:

   - Created a unified `EnrichedContext` interface in `source/types.ts`
   - Introduced a new `File` interface representing file structure
   - Moved from component orientation to file orientation
   - Refactored `context-enricher` implementation to use file-centric approach
   - Improved the `processFileImports` method to avoid mutation and return structured imports
   - Made `processedImports` an optional parameter for better API design

3. **Core Interface Changes**:

   ```typescript
   // New File interface
   export interface File {
   	fileName: string;
   	fileContent: string;
   	fileAbsolutePath: string;
   	pathRelativeToTestedFile?: string;
   	imports?: Record<string, File>;
   }

   // New EnrichedContext interface
   export interface EnrichedContext {
   	testedFile: File;
   	exampleTests?: Record<string, File>;
   	userProvidedContext?: string;
   }
   ```

4. **Implementation Changes**:
   - Changed file/component detection from AST traversal to simple naming conventions
   - Introduced proper import hierarchy with nested `File` objects
   - Removed React component detection logic
   - Created a cleaner, functional implementation that doesn't mutate objects

## High-Level Plan

Our plan for completing the refactoring:

1. **Update LangGraph Integration**

   - Define a clear contract in `FileState` for what's expected from context
   - Update `format-context.ts` utility to handle the new File structure
   - Update `apply-context.ts` node to extract data from testedFile

2. **Update Migrate Command**

   - Update `handleSingleFile` to use the new file-based structure
   - Replace transformation from testedComponent to componentName/componentCode
   - Update logging and file info extraction

3. **Update Parallel Migration**

   - Update worker function in `parallel-migration.ts`
   - Fix object creation for processSingleFile
   - Update metadata extraction for reporting

4. **Implementation Sequence**
   1. First: Update format-context utility
   2. Second: Update apply-context node
   3. Third: Update migrate.ts command
   4. Fourth: Update parallel-migration.ts

We will not:

- Create utility functions for backward compatibility
- Update the context-enricher and test-lint commands
- Add any compatibility layers

This refactoring is a hard, clean break moving to a file-centric approach throughout the codebase.

## Current Progress (Updated)

We have now completed the following refactoring steps:

1. ✅ Created unified `EnrichedContext` interface in `source/types.ts`
2. ✅ Refactored `context-enricher` implementation to use file-centric approach
3. ✅ Updated `FileState` interface to use the new EnrichedContext
4. ✅ Refactored `createWorkflow` function to directly use new EnrichedContext
5. ✅ Updated `migrate.ts` command to use the new EnrichedContext
6. ✅ Updated `parallel-migration.ts` to use the new EnrichedContext
7. ✅ Refactored workflow node flow to remove `load-test-file` and `apply-context` nodes
8. ✅ Updated `createWorkflow` to directly load test files
9. ✅ Enhanced `processSingleFile` function to handle file operations more directly
10. ✅ Updated file handling approach to use original files instead of temp files
11. ✅ Simplified handling of failed migrations by storing them in `.unshallow/ComponentName/` directory
12. ✅ Created a reusable context formatter utility to convert from file-centric state to node-specific prompt variables
13. ✅ Updated `plan-rtl-conversion` and `execute-rtl-conversion` nodes to use the new context formatter

## Prompt Context Formatter

We've implemented a reusable approach to context formatting in `source/langgraph-workflow/utils/context-formatter.ts`:

1. **Shared Base Formatter**: The `getCachedContextVars` function extracts common variables used across multiple prompts
2. **Node-Specific Formatters**:
   - `getPlanRtlConversionVars`
   - `getExecuteRtlConversionVars`
   - `getAnalyzeFailureVars`
   - `getExecuteRtlFixVars`
3. **Utility Functions**:
   - `formatFileImports`: Formats imports from a File object
   - `formatExampleTests`: Formats example tests from EnrichedContext
   - `extractComponentName`: Extracts component name from file name

This approach:

- Eliminates duplication across node implementations
- Ensures consistent formatting
- Simplifies transition from component-centric to file-centric approach
- Makes it easy to maintain prompt variable mapping

## New File Handling Approach

We've implemented a new file handling approach:

1. Original test files are always directly updated with RTL code (even for failed migrations)
2. For failed migrations, a copy of the working version is saved to `.unshallow/ComponentName/fileName.[test|spec].[jsx|tsx]` (same filename as original)
3. When retrying a migration, we check for the file in `.unshallow/ComponentName/` first
4. Temp files in the original directory are no longer created or used
5. All logs and artifacts are still stored in `.unshallow/ComponentName/`

This approach simplifies the implementation and improves user experience by:

- Eliminating temp files cluttering the workspace
- Making it clear which files need fixing (they're in the `.unshallow` directory)
- Supporting easier retry workflows

## Items to Clean Up

After our refactoring, we have completed the following cleanups:

1. ✅ Removed unused nodes from graph definition
2. ✅ Updated workflow to start directly with plan_rtl_conversion
3. ✅ Removed WorkflowStep enum entries for LOAD_TEST_FILE, LOAD_TEST_FILE_FAILED, and APPLY_CONTEXT
4. ✅ Removed temp file handling from TestFileSystem and ArtifactFileSystem
5. ✅ Updated finalizeMigration to directly write to original file
6. ✅ Deleted load-test-file.ts and apply-context.ts node files
7. ✅ Deleted format-context.ts utility
8. ✅ Cleaned up temp file references from ArtifactFileSystem

## Remaining Work

1. Perform testing of new file handling workflow, ensuring:

   - Original file is updated directly during migration
   - Failed migrations save to .unshallow/ComponentName/ directory
   - Retry mode loads from .unshallow/ComponentName/ directory

2. Explore optimization opportunities:
   - The removal of temp files should improve performance
   - Simplified file operation flow should reduce errors
   - File-centric approach provides better structure
