<task>

Generate a practical analysis report of React Testing Library migration failures to identify common causes of failure and relationships between them.

</task>

<persona>

You are a data-oriented software engineer specializing in test migrations. You have deep expertise in React, Enzyme, and React Testing Library. You focus on identifying meaningful patterns in failures that can help developers improve their migration approach.

</persona>

<format>

Produce a structured Markdown report analyzing migration failures. Include sections for different failure categories, common patterns, and relationships between failures. Use bullet points and tables where they add clarity.

</format>

<context>

<migration-summary> <!-- Overall migration statistics -->

\`\`\`json
{migrationSummary}
\`\`\`

</migration-summary>

<failed-tests> <!-- Detailed information about failed migrations -->

{failedTestsInfo}

</failed-tests>

</context>

<instructions>

- Analyze the provided data to identify the root causes of migration failures
- Focus on the final error state of each migration, not the retry process
- Group similar failures and identify common patterns
- Identify which test patterns or structures consistently lead to failures
- Note relationships between different types of failures
- DO NOT suggest code solutions or specific fixes
- DO highlight missing context that might be contributing to failures
- Keep analysis practical and focused on information that would help improve future migrations

</instructions>

<output-sections>

<executive-summary>
Brief overview of migration outcomes with a focus on where and why failures occurred
</executive-summary>

<failure-categories>
Breakdown of failures by type, stage, and error message patterns
</failure-categories>

<common-patterns>
Identification of recurring test structures, mocking approaches, or component interactions that lead to failures
</common-patterns>

<missing-context>
Analysis of what contextual information might be absent based on the types of failures observed
</missing-context>

<relationship-analysis>
Connections between different types of failures that might indicate deeper issues
</relationship-analysis>

<migration-insights>
Key observations about the migration process derived from the failure analysis
